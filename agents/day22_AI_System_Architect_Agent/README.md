# 🤖 AI System Architect Advisor Agent

## 💡 Problem

Designing complex software systems requires expertise in architecture patterns, infrastructure planning, security, and scalability. Teams often struggle to make informed architectural decisions, assess risks, and estimate costs effectively for diverse systems.

## 🚀 Solution

The AI System Architect Advisor Agent leverages a dual-model agent approach using DeepSeek R1 and Claude-3.5. DeepSeek Reasoner provides structured technical analysis and recommendations, while Claude generates detailed implementation roadmaps and explanations. This enables teams to receive comprehensive software architecture guidance efficiently.
